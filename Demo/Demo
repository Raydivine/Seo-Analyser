This is a simple demo for this project
- Seo Analyser

Search engine optimization (SEO) 
is the process of increasing the 
quality and quantity of website traffic 
by increasing visibility of a website 
or a web page to users of a web search engine

Now I am going to run my project


1. Filter Stop Words
Stop word is a commonly used word (such as “the”, “a”, “an”, “in”) 
that a search engine has been programmed to ignore.

2. Word listed in meta tags
Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a page’s content,
the meta tags don’t appear on the page itself, 
but only in the page’s code


A. Given I analyse a paragraph
I can get the number of occurance of words

B. Given I anayse a link
I can get all the details

Thanks~~
